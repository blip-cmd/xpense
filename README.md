## To Contribute:
Each teammate forks the repo, works in their feature branch, then submits a pull request

## How to Use
Navigate to src directory, compile and run Main.java with proper package structure:


**Write Once, Run Anywhere:**
```bash
cd src
javac -cp . app/Main.java
java -cp . app.Main
```

Note: The `-cp .` flag sets the classpath to the current directory, which is necessary for the package structure to work correctly.
