# Real Estate Expenditure System â€” Backlog (Outstanding Tasks Only)


### UI/UX Improvements
- Category colors
- default categories/phases should suit real estate

## **Urgent**

1. [Adams] Show options available at each stage to avoid repetitive work
2. [Adams] Unknown characters like emojis/cedis produce question marks
3. [Ransford] Analytics should be per account (ensure breakdown by account in analytics/report)
4. [Adams] Check if alert system is linked to bank accounts and if it's persisted
5. [Adams] Functions of the implemented alert system vs the expected (document differences)
6. [Ransford] COST Analysis report and Category breakdown are the same output (deduplicate/clarify)
7. [Ransford] Crosscheck analytics in account with Reports Menu ([viewAllCategoryStatistics, viewCategoryStatistics])

## **High Priority**

1. 
---

## **Medium Priority**

1. [Samuel] Phase field in expenditures table shows "active" not inputted string (fix phase/location bug)
3. [Adams] Quick options in MAIN MENU (e.g., 10. Add Expenditure)

---

## **Nice to Have**

? at each field shows what the field is for and sample values

1. [Adams] Add "HELP AND UTILITY METHODS" to CLI (show helper functions, usage tips)

---

## **DSA to Implement in UTIL (if not present already)**

- [Fenteng] `TreeMap` (simulate as SimpleTreeMap if not present)


---

## **QUESTIONS**

3. [Wisdom] Javadocs: How/where used? Can you print documentation directly?

---

## **Tasks for Immediate Discussion**

1. [All] Individual DSA Report (How each DSA works in program/module, how it simulates accountant workflow)
2. [All] Understand and implement all DSA (will be in util folder)
