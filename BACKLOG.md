# Nkwa Real Estate Expenditure System â€” Backlog (Outstanding Tasks Only)

---

## **Urgent**

1. [Adams] Exit point at any menu stage not working (only works in main menu)
2. [Adams] Show options available at each stage to avoid repetitive work
3. [Fenteng] Blank description edge case handling
4. [Adams] Unknown characters like emojis produce question marks
6. [Ransford] Analytics should be per account (ensure breakdown by account in analytics/report)
7. [Adams] Check if alert system is linked to bank accounts and if it's persisted
8. [Adams] Functions of the implemented alert system vs the expected (document differences)
9. [Ransford] COST Analysis report and Category breakdown are the same output (deduplicate/clarify)
10. [Ransford] Crosscheck analytics in account with Reports Menu ([viewAllCategoryStatistics, viewCategoryStatistics])

---

## **High Priority**

1. [Adams] Make CLI more user friendly (improve prompts, navigation)
2. [Ryan] Prompt to create category now if missing
3. [Adams] Cancel at any stage in CLI (add cancel/exit at every prompt)
4. [Michel] Receipt history not found (add CLI to view processed receipt history)
5. [Adams] Apply colors to CLI for improved usability

---

## **Medium Priority**

1. [Samuel] Location field in expenditures table shows "active" not inputted string (fix phase/location bug)
2. [Wisdom] Implement `import java.util.List; import java.util.ArrayList;` (simulate in util if needed for reporting)
3. [Adams] Press any key to continue after actions
4. [Adams] Show about info in help menu (add about/credits section)
5. [Adams] Quick options in MAIN MENU (e.g., 10. Add Expenditure)

---

## **Nice to Have**

1. [Adams] Add "HELP AND UTILITY METHODS" to CLI (show helper functions, usage tips)

---

## **DSA to Implement in UTIL (if not present already)**

- [Fenteng] `TreeMap` (simulate as SimpleTreeMap if not present)
- [Samuel/Wisdom] `Map`, `HashMap` (already SimpleMap, but add more if needed)
- [Michel] `PriorityQueue` (already MinHeap, but add if needed)
- [Ryan/Ransford] `List`, `ArrayList` (already SimpleArrayList, but add if needed)

---

## **QUESTIONS**

1. [Fenteng] Why use BigDecimal and not float/double?
2. [Fenteng] Are decimals limited to two places (pesewas)?
3. [Wisdom] Javadocs: How/where used? Can you print documentation directly?

---

## **Tasks for Immediate Discussion**

1. [All] Individual DSA Report (How each DSA works in program/module, how it simulates accountant workflow)
2. [All] Understand and implement all DSA (will be in util folder)
