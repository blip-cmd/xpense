# Real Estate Expenditure System â€” Backlog (Outstanding Tasks Only)

- Category.txt in two diff paths
  - Manual Add Category works
  - Auto Add Category also works
  - Unable to recreate the problem

- Invalid data should be specified.
    edit the CLIHandler to include more helpful error messages with examples.

- Generic Type T error.
  - Bullets not known to console

### UI/UX Improvements
- Category colors (NICE TO HAVE)
- default categories/phases should suit real estate (e.g., "Construction", "Maintenance", etc. ) (NICE TO HAVE)
