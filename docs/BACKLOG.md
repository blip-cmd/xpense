# Real Estate Expenditure System - Backlog (Outstanding Tasks Only)

- Generic Type T error on console compilation.
  - Bullets not known to console

### UI/UX Improvements
- Category colors (NICE TO HAVE)
- default categories/phases should suit real estate (e.g., "Construction", "Maintenance", etc. ) (NICE TO HAVE)


## **Urgent**
DONE doesn't imply TESTED

2. [Adams] Unknown characters produce question marks ✓ FIXED
   - Replaced all Unicode bullet points (•) with ASCII hyphens (-) in CLIHandler.java
   - Replaced all em dashes (—) with regular hyphens (-) in README.md and BACKLOG.md
   - Fixed cents symbol (¢) to "cents" text in CLIHandler.java
   - All characters now display correctly in console

## **DSA to Implement in UTIL (if not present already)**

## **QUESTIONS**
1. [Wisdom] Javadocs: How/where used? Can you print documentation directly?

---

## **Tasks for Immediate Discussion**

1. [All] Individual DSA Report (How each DSA works with the programme module, how it simulates accountant workflow) - check the Submission Report
2. [All] Understand all the implemented  DSA (will be in util folder)
