SEMESTER PROJECT (GROUP)
Expenditure Management System for Nkwa Real Estate Ltd
Nkwa Real Estate is a growing construction firm focused on delivering low-cost housing
solutions across peri-urban communities in Ghana. As the company expands, financial
monitoring during construction and post-sales activities has become increasingly
challenging. Accountants must now track multiple bank accounts, fluctuating supplier
costs, and a maze of construction-phase spending.
The company lacks a digital solution. You’ve been invited to build a locally stored, offline-
first Expenditure Tracking Application—built from the ground up using fundamental data
structures. Your system should simulate accountant workflows, not just automate them.
Project Tasks
Develop a menu-driven command-line system that leverages data structures including:
arrays, stacks, queues, linked lists, sets, maps, trees, hash maps, and graphs. Avoid external
libraries, databases, or prebuilt sorting/searching modules.
Functional Requirements
1. Expenditure Records
o Record each expenditure with details:
 Code, amount, date, phase (e.g., construction, marketing, sales),
category, account used.
o Store in hash maps or linked lists, allowing retrieval by expenditure code.
2. Category Management
o Create a dynamic list of expenditure categories (e.g., “Cement”, “Printing”,
“TV Adverts”).
o Implement sets or hash tables to ensure category uniqueness and support
category searches.
3. Bank Account Ledger
2
o Store and update information about different company bank accounts, each
with:
 Account ID, bank name, balance, list of related expenditures.
o Use maps or dictionaries and create a relationship graph if accounts are
internally related.
4. Search & Sort
o Sort expenditures by:
 Alphabetical order of category
 Chronological order of transaction
o Search by:
 Time range (e.g., “all expenses in April 2025”)
 Category
 Cost range
 Bank account used
5. Invoice/Receipt Handling
o Link each expenditure to a receipt/invoice record stored in a file or internal
pointer-like structure.
o Use a queue or stack to simulate upload and review queues for accounting
validation.
6. Bank Tracker
o Every expenditure draws funds from a selected bank account.
o The application must update balances, log expenditures, and notify if an
account is low on funds using a min-heap.
7. Cash Flow & Financial Analysis
o Implement logic to:
 Track monthly burn rate.
 Forecast profitability based on spending patterns.
